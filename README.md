# My Now Page
(last updated: Oct. 17, 2025 | actively maintained)
## 👋 Hi, I’m @xeeban (Nori Nishigaya)
Welcome to my GitHub profile! It is also my current [Now Page](https://nownownow.com/about). Here, I will keep my current work, interests, inspirations up to date. If anything that you read here resonates, feel free to reach out using any of the "How to Reach Me" methods listed below.

## 😳 About me
I am dedicated to fostering inclusivity and community, building decentralized governance models, and enabling collaborative decision-making in complex and emergent environments.

I am Source (see [Work with Source](https://workwithsource.com/)) for [ODIN](https://www.odin.eco), a network of innovators who believe that decentralized innovation networks will replace centralized corporations as the primary way we solve hard problems in the world. ODIN experiments with and mentors evolutionary organizational principles, and creates ways to scale through connecting high-trust spaces so that innovation networks and their members can thrive.

I am a co-founder of [Andamio](https://www.andamio.io). Andamio’s mission is to create a Trust Protocol on which can be built applications and software that enables communities, organizations, and ecosystems to build a network of Trust that is verifiable and secure. We are in the midst of an evolutionary pivot at the moment, so this will evolve over the next little while!

In my free time, I enjoy diving deep into the intersection of blockchain, AI, decentralization, bio-region/local re-vitalization, and Integral theory. I am also a practicing Zen Buddhist.

## 🌍 Current location/timezone
Currently based in Victoria, BC, Canada (Pacific Time - UTC-8/UTC-7)

## 🪏 What I am currently working on
- [Andamio](https://www.andamio.io/)
- [ODIN](https://www.odin.eco/)
- 100 Days of AI
	- AI is becoming more and more important in our current global context. I will spend the next 100 days (starting Sep. 15, 2025) to dive deeply into AI and learn how to use these emerging technologies while preserving what makes us uniquely human. Journey before Destination. If you want to join me on this, I'd love some fellow travelers to bounce ideas off of and discuss what's emerging.

## 👀 What I am obsessed about
- e-ink readers and tablets
	- I bought a [Boox Palma 2](https://shop.boox.com/products/palma2) and use it to help me with staying distraction free as I only install Kindle reader and Obsidian on the device so I can be notification and distraction free when I wish
	- Still pondering the usefulness of a [Supernote Manta](https://supernote.com/pages/supernote-manta) or a [reMarkable Paper Pro Move](https://remarkable.com/products/remarkable-paper/pro-move)
- decentralized collaboration across geography and timezones
	- async and habits/rituals that enable better participation

## 🧠 I’m interested in 
- Decentralized Collaboration and Governance
- Teal and Self-managed organizations
- Sense-making
- Self-sovereignty
- Decentralization / Swarms / Murmurations / Collective Intelligence

- What role should AI play in augmenting human decision-making without replacing human agency?
- How do we balance structure and emergence in self-organizing systems?
- What does authentic leadership look like in decentralized networks?
- How can we create economic models that reward collaboration over competition?

- Point me toward research on collective intelligence and swarm behavior
- Suggest ways to measure trust and social capital in networks

## 📫 How to reach me
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Xeeban)
- [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/xeeban.bsky.social)

While I am on Twitter/X, Linked-in, Slack, Signal, and BlueSky, I may not respond for days or even months at a time as I do not use those platforms on a daily basis. The most reliable way to get a hold of me is via Discord or to send me an email. On Discord, DM or tag me on the Andamio or ODIN servers. I have notifications turned off on all other servers to help me focus.
